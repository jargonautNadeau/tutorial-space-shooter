<h1>Welcome</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This project is based on Unity Technologies tutorial series https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial There might be some little changes here and there but this was a great way of getting myself used to the process of developing in Unity the way that Unity wants me to develop. There are always great organizational tips to learn from watching these tutorials and even might find some shortcuts to pull rigidbody velocity.</p>
